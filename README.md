A most basic boilerplate for react to use as a starting point to build great things

This is a boilerplate project using the following technologies:
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for the frontend
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for styles (using the SASS indented syntax)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for compilation


## Requirements

```shell
npm install

```

Thats all folks

No server set up in this project
